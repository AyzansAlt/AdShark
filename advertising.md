## How to make a banner

You could use Photoshop, but I use Paint.Net, either way, make a 600x150 .png file and upload it to [Mediafire](https://www.mediafire.com) or another file uploading service.

 Then, make an issue on our [GitHub issue](https://github.com/AyzansAlt/AdShark) that contains the link.
